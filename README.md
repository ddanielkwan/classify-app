# Machine Learning Classify App

# Purpose:

For my own learning experience, I used multiple machine learning models ( SVM, NB ) to classify text data and detect if they are spam.

# What I did:

I gathered data of emails and twitter tweets and turned them into vectors using TFIDF and vectorizer in sklearn.
I fed them into my supervised learning models to predict new input.
Integrated AWS Polly to have text to speech and used tkinter library to create the GUI.
Added settings for customization of interface.
Created visualizations on email data, word clouds, bar graphs ..

# Things to do:

- Add AWS transcribe to perform speech to text
- Fix a few buttons, add better pictures
- add facebook post clasifier

# Prototype
